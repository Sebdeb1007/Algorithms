# Algorithms

## Bundling of smalls projects


1. ### Graph Theory[^1].

Useful stuff regarding graph theory in python: 

- Classes for creating graph (undirected, directed, weighted).
- Search algorithms ( bfs ,recursive dfs , iterative dfs).
- Working in progress --> shortest path (djkistra, prim).
        

2. ### Maze solver.

the purpose of this mini-project is to solve mazes using graph theory (djikstra)

Features :

- Create graph from a maze ( matrix of 0 and 1 where 1 are walls).
- Solve mazes.
- Generate the solved mazes as png files.
- Generate the graph version of a maze.
